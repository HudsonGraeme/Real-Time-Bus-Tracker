# Week 13 - Formik Login Form

[![Edit Formik-Login](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/happy-sammet-yr2tx?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview)

## Description

This is a simple login form created in ReactJS, using [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) and BootStrap. It contains basic client side validation and a nifty alert message that appears when the email and password both pass basic validation.

### Features

- Email validation against a basic RegEx

- Password & Email validation against null values

- BootStrap theming for alert messages and the form

## Installation

- Download the project files `cd` into the downloaded directory and run `npm start` in your favorite terminal

## Usage

This form is used by attempting to enter invalid values for the email and password fields and verifying the correct validation errors are thrown. Otherwise, logging in regularly using valid syntax for an email address and providing a password value should result in both a regular browser alert as well as a BootStrap alert appearing, indicating the login was a success.

## Support

- If there are any bugs present feel free to create an issue in the parent repo, or make a PR.

## Roadmap

- This project is complete and will no longer be maintained unless a bug is found (an issue or PR is opened)
