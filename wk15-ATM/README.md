# Week 15 - reactATM

A simple ATM frontend application built using ReactJS and Bootstrap.

## Description

This is a simple frontend application that simulates the functionality of an ATM. The page allows one to enter deposit and withdrawal values while validating input and keeping track of transactions.

### Features

-   View a transaction log of all transactions completed

-   Input is validated against non-numbers and withdrawals above your balance

## Installation

-   Download the project files `cd` into the downloaded directory and run your favourite http server to start the site. ([Live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) is awesome)

## Usage

Open the site and enter a numerical value of the $ amount you intend to deposit. Press the `Deposit $_.__` button to add the value to your balance and to show the transaction in the log below. From here, you can withdraw and deposit virtual reactBucks through the selection box - `Deposit` or `Withdraw`.

## Support

-   If there are any bugs present feel free to create an issue in the parent repo, or make a PR.

## Roadmap

-   This project is complete and will no longer be maintained unless a bug is found (an issue or PR is opened)
