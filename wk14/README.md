# Week 14 - Yet Another Shopping List (YASL)

## Description

This is a simple shopping list web app made with ReactJS. It allows users the ability to add items through a text input, then increase, decrease and remove item quantities from a list. Users can copy individual items with their quantities or copy the entire list to their clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere.

### Features

- Copy the entire list or individual entries to your clipboard

- Add items at will

- Modify and remove items in the list

## Installation

- Download the project files `cd` into the downloaded directory and run your favourite http server to start the site. ([Live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) is awesome)

## Usage

Begin adding items to the list by selecting the text field at the top of the page and entering the name of a product to be added to the list. Press the return key to send the item into the list. Modify the item's quanitity with `<` and `>` for increment and decrement respectively, or use `-` to remove the item entirely. By clicking on any of the items, it will be automatically copied into your clipboard. There is also a button at the bottom of the page which will allow you to copy the entire list into your clipboard, in the format `item - quantity`.

## Support
