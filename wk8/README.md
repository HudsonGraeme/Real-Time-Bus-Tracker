# Week 8 - Eye Execise

## Description

The eye exercse uses two eyeballs on the screen to follow a mouse cusor as it travels within the document. In this version, a slider is provided to control the opacity (or sleepiness) of the eyes. As well, by double clicking on the view, the background colour will shift ten degrees of hue over.

### Features

* Dynamic background colour based on mouse clicks

* Cursor tracking

* Bloodshot eyes (due to excessive exposure to the LCD they reside on)

* A slider which controls how far asleep the eyes currently are

## Installation

* Download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your browser

## Usage

After launching the webpage you will be shown two eyes. Moving your mouse cursor around will result in the eyes tracking your cursor. To change the background colour, simply double click anywhere on the screen and a new colour will be provided. One may adjust the tiredness slider to determine the opacity of the eyes.

## Support

* If there are any bugs present feel free to create an issue in the parent repo, or make a PR.

## Roadmap

* This project is complete and will no longer be maintained unless a bug is found (an issue or PR is opened)
